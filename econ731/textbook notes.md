## The Nature of Econometrics and Economic Data

### What is Econometrics?

1. Econometrics is based upon the development of statistical methods for:
   1. estimating economic relationships
   2. testing economic theories
   3. evaluating and implementing government and business policy
2. Difference between Econometrics and Mathematical Statistics:
   - Econometrics focuses on problems inherent in collecting and analyzing nonexperimental economic data.
     - Nonexperimental data are not accumulated through controlled experiments on individuals, firms, or segments of the economy. 
     - Nonexperimental data are sometimes called observational data, or retrospective data, to emphasize the fact that the researcher is a passive collector of the data.
   - Experimental data are often collected in laboratory environments in the natural sciences, but they are more difficult to obtain in the social sciences.

### Steps in Empirical Economic Analysis

1. Empirical analysis: A study that uses data in a formal econometric analysis to test a theory, estimate a relationship, or determine the effectiveness of a policy.
2. Structuring an empirical economic analysis first requires careful formulation of the question of interest.
3. Economic model: Mathematical equations that describe various relationships derived from economic theory or less formal economic reasoning.
4. Utility maximization: The basic premise underlying economic models; leads to a set of demand equations.
   - Individuals make choices to maximize their well-being, subject to resource constraints, gives a framework for creating tractable economic models and making clear predictions.
5. Demand equation: the quantity demanded of each commodity depends on the price of the goods, the price of substitute and complementary goods, the consumer’s income, and the individual’s characteristics that affect taste.
