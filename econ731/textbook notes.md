## The Nature of Econometrics and Economic Data

### What is Econometrics?

1. Econometrics is based upon the development of statistical methods for:
   1. estimating economic relationships
   2. testing economic theories
   3. evaluating and implementing government and business policy
2. Difference between Econometrics and Mathematical Statistics:
   - Econometrics focuses on problems inherent in collecting and analyzing nonexperimental economic data.
     - Nonexperimental data are not accumulated through controlled experiments on individuals, firms, or segments of the economy. 
     - Nonexperimental data are sometimes called observational data, or retrospective data, to emphasize the fact that the researcher is a passive collector of the data.
   - Experimental data are often collected in laboratory environments in the natural sciences, but they are more difficult to obtain in the social sciences.
