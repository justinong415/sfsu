## The Nature of Econometrics and Economic Data

### What is Econometrics?

1. Econometrics is based upon the development of statistical methods for:
   1. estimating economic relationships
   2. testing economic theories
   3. evaluating and implementing government and business policy
2. Difference between Econometrics and Mathematical Statistics:
   - Econometrics focuses on problems inherent in collecting and analyzing nonexperimental economic data.
     - Nonexperimental data are not accumulated through controlled experiments on individuals, firms, or segments of the economy. 
     - Nonexperimental data are sometimes called observational data, or retrospective data, to emphasize the fact that the researcher is a passive collector of the data.
   - Experimental data are often collected in laboratory environments in the natural sciences, but they are more difficult to obtain in the social sciences.

### Steps in Empirical Economic Analysis

1. Empirical analysis: A study that uses data in a formal econometric analysis to test a theory, estimate a relationship, or determine the effectiveness of a policy.
2. Structuring an empirical economic analysis first requires careful formulation of the question of interest.
3. Economic model: Mathematical equations that describe various relationships derived from economic theory or less formal economic reasoning.
4. Utility maximization: The basic premise underlying economic models; leads to a set of demand equations.
   - Individuals make choices to maximize their well-being, subject to resource constraints, gives a framework for creating tractable economic models and making clear predictions.
5. Demand equation: the quantity demanded of each commodity depends on the price of the goods, the price of substitute and complementary goods, the consumer’s income, and the individual’s characteristics that affect taste.

  <summary>Example: Economic Model of Crime</summary>

   1. Gary Becker postulated a utility maximization framework to describe an individual’s participation in crime. 
   2. Certain crimes have clear economic rewards, but most criminal behaviors have costs. 
   3. The opportunity costs of crime prevent the criminal from participating in other activities such as legal employment.
   4. In addition, there are costs associated with the possibility of being caught and then, if convicted, the costs associated with incarceration. 
   5. The decision to undertake illegal activity is one of resource allocation, with the benefits and costs of competing activities taken into account.

   Under general assumptions, we can derive an equation describing the amount of time spent in criminal activity as a function of various factors. We might represent such a function as

   $$ y = f(x_1) $$
