#### Four Major Questions in Environmental Economics

1. How much pollution is too much?
   - What is "too much"?
     - Economic efficiency: maximizes net benefits (B-C)
        - Generate values for costs and benefits of environmental protection.
        - Apply the neoclassical economics framework to find the right level.
     - Safety: reduce pollution to "safe" levels
     - Economic sustainability: protect natural ecosystems from major changes.
        - Unless costs of doing so are prohibitive.
2. Is government up to the job?
   - Obstacles to effective government intervention:
     1. Imperfect information
     2. Political influence (who affects decisionmaking)
     3. Conflicts over property rights
     4. Conservative v progressive views of government's role
3. How can we do better?
   - Tools
     1. "Command-and-control regulation"
     2. Policies to promote clean technologies
        1. Research and development funding
        2. Subsidies for infant industries
        3. Infrastructure investment
        4. Technical efficiency standards
        5. Technical assistance
     3. Price system approaches, e.g.:
        - To achieve 4° F, global carbon tax of $70/ton today rising to $224/ton by 2050
        - To achieve 5° F, global carbon tax of $25/ton today rising to $93/ton by 2050
        - To achieve 5° F, emissions quotas for each country, with transferable credits
4. Can we resolve global issues?
   - Halt unsustainable exploitation of natural resources
   - Slow global warming
   - How to develop effective international agreements?

### 50 Years of Environmental Economics

[Fullerton-EnvEcon-cesifo1_wp8075.pdf](https://github.com/justinong415/sfsu/files/9421340/Fullerton-EnvEcon-cesifo1_wp8075.pdf)

Environmental Economics: The 50th Anniversary of the Birth of This Field around the First Earth Day - Don Fullerton 

1. First Earth Day: April 22nd, 1970.
2. Pollution is a market failure that can be corrected.
   - By identifying market failures that create pollution and helping to design
policy proposals that maximize cost-effectiveness, economics can be a powerful tool
for environmental protection
3. Arthur Pigou in 1920 proposed a government tax per unit of pollution (Pigouvian tax on pollution).
5. Ronald Coase in 1960 argued private interactions could solve pollution problems when property rights are well defined and transactions costs are low.
   - In Coase’s scenario, no government regulation meant that polluters could pollute, but victims downstream could simply pay the polluter to cut back emissions to a mutually agreeable level.
6. Most economists before 1968 largely ignored the study of the environment.
7. 1974 – the dawning of "environmental economics"; founding of the *Journal of Environmental Economics and Management*.
8. 1968 - biologist Garrett Hardin published an article in *Science* ‘**The Tragedy of the Commons**’.
   - unregulated use of a commons – a place that everybody can use, with no real owner – could lead to unsustainable exploitation and environmental degradation of the oceans, land and
atmosphere.
   - argument largely based on biology and demography; many economists argue fundamental problem was lack of ownership.
   - Reasoning: a clean environment represents a public good that provides health and aesthetic benefits to millions
   - once provided, clean air is available to others to breathe at the same time and at no additional cost
   - consumers will not buy clean air, because they can breathe whether they pay or not
   - free-riding behavior; no business would voluntarily pay the costs associated with cleaning up the air
   - firms who do not clean up will be able to charge a lower price for their goods/services, gaining a market advantage
9. Answer is **Ownership**
   - If someone possessed a resource, they would protect their property.
   - But private markets fail to provide public goods such as roads, law and order, defense.
     - Lighthouse example: when built, its light can provide navigation benefits to additional boats at no additional costs
     - But no business could recover cost of lighthosue, since boaters can use the light whether they pay or not
     - "Free riders" cause the private market to fail, even though social benefits exceed costs 
10. Major economic problem of environmental protection:
    - Even if positive net benefits overall, some receive disproportionate benefits, other bear disproportionate costs.
    - Economic analysis can meaasure the distribution of gains and losses from proposed policies
      - Can also help design a policy package that achieves pollution reduction and desired objectives for distribution of gains and losses
11. US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), established 1970
    - Focused on technological and legal frameworks to control pollution with little consideration of economic implications.
    - Environmental protection viewed as moral imperative, costs were not taken into account.
12. In contrast, **environmental economics analyze both costs and benefits of environmental protection schemes**.
    - Often found that costs of actual legislative and regulatory changes were significantly higher than other policies that could achieve the same degree of environmental protection.
    - Economically efficient approaches could lead to greater environmental protection for the same level of financial investment.
13. John Harkness Dales, 1968
    - Idea for minimizing the cost of achieving any given degree of environmental protection.
    - Government could limit the total amount of pollution at an appropriate low level, print a fixed number of permits or licenses, and let polluters bid for the permits or trade with each other.
    - The key innovation of Dales’ idea was to recognize that a particular required mitigation technology cannot logically be ‘best’ in all different circumstances. 
      - Policymakers in the nation’s capital cannot possibly know as much about production technologies as the engineers inside each firm, especially when those technologies vary across firms. 
      - The same pollution reduction could be achieved by letting each firm determine their own ‘best’ method. 
    - With **permit trading**, a firm with limited options can essentially pay a different firm to do their required pollution reduction, through a so-called ‘cap-and-trade’ approach.
      - With a single market price (e.g. $100 per metric ton of sulfur dioxide emissions), a tradeable permit system provides incentive for any firm to develop emission reduction strategies that cost less than $100 per metric ton. 
      - Firms would bypass any technology costing more than $100 to reduce emissions per metric ton, choosing the more economical approach of simply buying an emissions permit instead.
13. William Baumol and Wallace Oates, 1971, various approaches to implementing pollution pricing policies
14. 1972, David Montgomery showed exactly what conditions would be necessary for a permit policy to minimize the total social cost of pollution abatement
15. 1974 paper by Martin Weitzman that explored the difference between taxation and permit policy as a means of pollution pricing
16. A tax on pollution fixes the price of pollution, but it does not necessarily limit the total quantity of emissions.
    - Firms facing a fixed price will decide their quantity of pollution and thus the total amount they are willing to pay for it. 
    - If policymakers knew the total quantity of pollution that would result under a given taxation scheme, they could fix that quantity of pollution by printing a fixed number of tradable permits
    - Under this permit system, the market would be expected to produce an equivalent pollution price for the same quantity of emissions
    - But the critical difference relates to future uncertainty as market conditions evolve.
    - Limiting the quantity of pollution through a permitting system is great for ensuring a clean environment, but firms cannot be sure what price they will have to pay in the future. 
    - That uncertainty can inhibit investment and reduce growth, raising costs
    - On the other hand, setting the price of pollution through taxation is great for ensuring a known cost of production (and thus certainty for investors), but this approach creates uncertainty about the total amount of resulting pollution.
17. Which policy, taxation or permitting, better maximizes total social welfare – accounting for all economic and environmental costs and benefits?
    - answer depends on the relative impacts of uncertain economic costs as compared to uncertain environmental costs. 

### Chapter 1 Four main questions in environmental economics

#### Four Economic Questions about Global Warming

1. How much pollution is too much?
   - “At what level are the benefits of pollution outweighed by its costs?
   - Zero pollution is an unachievable and undesirable goal; pollution a by-product of living
2. Is government up to the job?
3. How can we do better?
   -  Possible policies: regulations, taxes, permit systems, technology subsidies (or their removal), research incentives, infrastructure investment, right-to-know laws, product labeling, legal liability, fines, and jail terms.
4. Can we resolve global issues?
   - regulating pollution within a single nation is difficult, yet global warming transcends national boundaries

Highlighted terms:

1. Greenhouse gas - compound that traps reflected heat from the earth’s surface and contributes to global warming
2. The first major impact will be on patterns of temperature, flooding, and drought, affecting agricultural output.
   - Northerly regions may experience an increase in precipitation and yields, but the grain belts of the US, Australia, and central Europe will become drier and agricultural output will fall.
3. Natural ecosystems will suffer; boundary of forest ecosystems will move northward by 600 kilometers
4. Ocean acidification: ocean continues to acidify, life at the base of the ocean food chain could begin to die off
5. Sea-level rise as ice caps begin to melt, and the warming ocean expands
6. Catastrophic outcomes - collapse and melting of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets, raising sea levels by 40+ feet
7. Global warming is a consequence of the greenhouse effect: 
   - Solar energy enters the earth’s biosphere in the form of visible and ultraviolet light from the sun
   - much of it is radiated back into the biosphere as infrared radiation or heat
   - The CO2 and other greenhouse gases surrounding the earth let in the visible and ultraviolet light from the sun.
   - like a blanket, these gases trap the reflected infrared radiation (heat) close to the earth’s surface
8. Uncertainty in predicting the degree of global warming is due to positive and negative feedback effects
   - global warming will trigger a runaway greenhouse effect, in which the initial warming will feed on itself.
