#### Four Major Questions in Environmental Economics

1. How much pollution is too much?
   - What is "too much"?
     - Economic efficiency: maximizes net benefits (B-C)
        - Generate values for costs and benefits of environmental protection.
        - Apply the neoclassical economics framework to find the right level.
     - Safety: reduce pollution to "safe" levels
     - Economic sustainability: protect natural ecosystems from major changes.
        - Unless costs of doing so are prohibitive.
2. Is government up to the job?
   - Obstacles to effective government intervention:
     1. Imperfect information
     2. Political influence (who affects decisionmaking)
     3. Conflicts over property rights
     4. Conservative v progressive views of government's role
3. How can we do better?
   - Tools
     1. "Command-and-control regulation"
     2. Policies to promote clean technologies
        1. Research and development funding
        2. Subsidies for infant industries
        3. Infrastructure investment
        4. Technical efficiency standards
        5. Technical assistance
     3. Price system approaches, e.g.:
        - To achieve 4° F, global carbon tax of $70/ton today rising to $224/ton by 2050
        - To achieve 5° F, global carbon tax of $25/ton today rising to $93/ton by 2050
        - To achieve 5° F, emissions quotas for each country, with transferable credits
4. Can we resolve global issues?
   - Halt unsustainable exploitation of natural resources
   - Slow global warming
   - How to develop effective international agreements?

#### How Hot will it get?
1. Atmospheric $CO^2$ levels in 1880: 280ppm. Now: +400 ppm.
2. Global temperature rise since 1880: 2.0° F (>1.0° C)
3. By 2100: +3° F to + 9° over 1800 levels.
4. Last Ice Age: Avg global temp ~9° F colder than today.

### 50 Years of Environmental Economics

[Fullerton-EnvEcon-cesifo1_wp8075.pdf](https://github.com/justinong415/sfsu/files/9421340/Fullerton-EnvEcon-cesifo1_wp8075.pdf)

Environmental Economics: The 50th Anniversary of the Birth of This Field around the First Earth Day - Don Fullerton 

1. First Earth Day: April 22nd, 1970.
2. Pollution is a market failure that can be corrected.
   - By identifying market failures that create pollution and helping to design
policy proposals that maximize cost-effectiveness, economics can be a powerful tool
for environmental protection
3. Arthur Pigou in 1920 proposed a government tax per unit of pollution (Pigouvian tax on pollution).
5. Ronald Coase in 1960 argued private interactions could solve pollution problems when property rights are well defined and transactions costs are low.
   - In Coase’s scenario, no government regulation meant that polluters could pollute, but victims downstream could simply pay the polluter to cut back emissions to a mutually agreeable level.
6. Most economists before 1968 largely ignored the study of the environment.
7. 1974 – the dawning of "environmental economics"; founding of the *Journal of Environmental Economics and Management*.
8. 1968 - biologist Garrett Hardin published an article in *Science* ‘**The Tragedy of the Commons**’.
   - unregulated use of a commons – a place that everybody can use, with no real owner – could lead to unsustainable exploitation and environmental degradation of the oceans, land and
atmosphere.
   - argument largely based on biology and demography; many economists argue fundamental problem was lack of ownership.
   - Reasoning: a clean environment represents a public good that provides health and aesthetic benefits to millions
   - once provided, clean air is available to others to breathe at the same time and at no additional cost
   - consumers will not buy clean air, because they can breathe whether they pay or not
   - free-riding behavior; no business would voluntarily pay the costs associated with cleaning up the air
   - firms who do not clean up will be able to charge a lower price for their goods/services, gaining a market advantage
9. Ownership
   - If someone possessed a resource, they would protect their property.
   - But private markets fail to provide public goods such as roads, law and order, defense.
     - Lighthouse example: when built, its light can provide navigation benefits to additional boats at no additional costs
     - But no business could recover cost of lighthosue, since boaters can use the light whether they pay or not
     - "Free riders" cause the private market to fail, even though social benefits exceed costs 
10. Major economic problem of environmental protection:
    - Even if positive net benefits overall, some receive disproportionate benefits, other bear disproportionate costs.
    - Economic analysis can meaasure the distribution of gains and losses from proposed policies
      - Can also help design a policy package that achieves pollution reduction and desired objectives for distribution of gains and losses
