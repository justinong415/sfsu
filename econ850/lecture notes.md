#### Four Major Questions in Environmental Economics

1. How much pollution is too much?
   - What is "too much"?
     - Economic efficiency: maximizes net benefits (B-C)
        - Generate values for costs and benefits of environmental protection.
        - Apply the neoclassical economics framework to find the right level.
     - Safety: reduce pollution to "safe" levels
     - Economic sustainability: protect natural ecosystems from major changes.
        - Unless costs of doing so are prohibitive.
2. Is government up to the job?
   - Obstacles to effective government intervention:
     1. Imperfect information
     2. Political influence (who affects decisionmaking)
     3. Conflicts over property rights
     4. Conservative v progressive views of government's role
3. How can we do better?
   - Tools
     1. "Command-and-control regulation"
     2. Policies to promote clean technologies
        1. Research and development funding
        2. Subsidies for infant industries
        3. Infrastructure investment
        4. Technical efficiency standards
        5. Technical assistance
     3. Price system approaches, e.g.:
        - To achieve 4° F, global carbon tax of $70/ton today rising to $224/ton by 2050
        - To achieve 5° F, global carbon tax of $25/ton today rising to $93/ton by 2050
        - To achieve 5° F, emissions quotas for each country, with transferable credits
4. Can we resolve global issues?
   - Halt unsustainable exploitation of natural resources
   - Slow global warming
   - How to develop effective international agreements?

### 50 Years of Environmental Economics

[Fullerton-EnvEcon-cesifo1_wp8075.pdf](https://github.com/justinong415/sfsu/files/9421340/Fullerton-EnvEcon-cesifo1_wp8075.pdf)

Environmental Economics: The 50th Anniversary of the Birth of This Field around the First Earth Day - Don Fullerton 

1. First Earth Day: April 22nd, 1970.
2. Pollution is a market failure that can be corrected.
   - By identifying market failures that create pollution and helping to design
policy proposals that maximize cost-effectiveness, economics can be a powerful tool
for environmental protection
3. Arthur Pigou in 1920 proposed a government tax per unit of pollution (Pigouvian tax on pollution).
5. Ronald Coase in 1960 argued private interactions could solve pollution problems when property rights are well defined and transactions costs are low.
   - In Coase’s scenario, no government regulation meant that polluters could pollute, but victims downstream could simply pay the polluter to cut back emissions to a mutually agreeable level.
6. Most economists before 1968 largely ignored the study of the environment.
7. 1974 – the dawning of "environmental economics"; founding of the *Journal of Environmental Economics and Management*.
8. 1968 - biologist Garrett Hardin published an article in *Science* ‘**The Tragedy of the Commons**’.
   - unregulated use of a commons – a place that everybody can use, with no real owner – could lead to unsustainable exploitation and environmental degradation of the oceans, land and
atmosphere.
   - argument largely based on biology and demography; many economists argue fundamental problem was lack of ownership.
   - Reasoning: a clean environment represents a public good that provides health and aesthetic benefits to millions
   - once provided, clean air is available to others to breathe at the same time and at no additional cost
   - consumers will not buy clean air, because they can breathe whether they pay or not
   - free-riding behavior; no business would voluntarily pay the costs associated with cleaning up the air
   - firms who do not clean up will be able to charge a lower price for their goods/services, gaining a market advantage
9. Answer is **Ownership**
   - If someone possessed a resource, they would protect their property.
   - But private markets fail to provide public goods such as roads, law and order, defense.
     - Lighthouse example: when built, its light can provide navigation benefits to additional boats at no additional costs
     - But no business could recover cost of lighthosue, since boaters can use the light whether they pay or not
     - "Free riders" cause the private market to fail, even though social benefits exceed costs 
10. Major economic problem of environmental protection:
    - Even if positive net benefits overall, some receive disproportionate benefits, other bear disproportionate costs.
    - Economic analysis can meaasure the distribution of gains and losses from proposed policies
      - Can also help design a policy package that achieves pollution reduction and desired objectives for distribution of gains and losses
11. US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), established 1970
    - Focused on technological and legal frameworks to control pollution with little consideration of economic implications.
    - Environmental protection viewed as moral imperative, costs were not taken into account.
12. In contrast, **environmental economics analyze both costs and benefits of environmental protection schemes**.
    - Often found that costs of actual legislative and regulatory changes were significantly higher than other policies that could achieve the same degree of environmental protection.
    - Economically efficient approaches could lead to greater environmental protection for the same level of financial investment.
13. John Harkness Dales, 1968
    - Idea for minimizing the cost of achieving any given degree of environmental protection.
    - Government could limit the total amount of pollution at an appropriate low level, print a fixed number of permits or licenses, and let polluters bid for the permits or trade with each other.
    - The key innovation of Dales’ idea was to recognize that a particular required mitigation technology cannot logically be ‘best’ in all different circumstances. 
      - Policymakers in the nation’s capital cannot possibly know as much about production technologies as the engineers inside each firm, especially when those technologies vary across firms. 
      - The same pollution reduction could be achieved by letting each firm determine their own ‘best’ method. 
    - With **permit trading**, a firm with limited options can essentially pay a different firm to do their required pollution reduction, through a so-called ‘cap-and-trade’ approach.
      - With a single market price (e.g. $100 per metric ton of sulfur dioxide emissions), a tradeable permit system provides incentive for any firm to develop emission reduction strategies that cost less than $100 per metric ton. 
      - Firms would bypass any technology costing more than $100 to reduce emissions per metric ton, choosing the more economical approach of simply buying an emissions permit instead.
13. William Baumol and Wallace Oates, 1971, various approaches to implementing pollution pricing policies
14. 1972, David Montgomery showed exactly what conditions would be necessary for a permit policy to minimize the total social cost of pollution abatement
15. 1974 paper by Martin Weitzman that explored the difference between taxation and permit policy as a means of pollution pricing
16. A tax on pollution fixes the price of pollution, but it does not necessarily limit the total quantity of emissions.
    - Firms facing a fixed price will decide their quantity of pollution and thus the total amount they are willing to pay for it. 
    - If policymakers knew the total quantity of pollution that would result under a given taxation scheme, they could fix that quantity of pollution by printing a fixed number of tradable permits
    - Under this permit system, the market would be expected to produce an equivalent pollution price for the same quantity of emissions
    - But the critical difference relates to future uncertainty as market conditions evolve.
    - Limiting the quantity of pollution through a permitting system is great for ensuring a clean environment, but firms cannot be sure what price they will have to pay in the future. 
    - That uncertainty can inhibit investment and reduce growth, raising costs
    - On the other hand, setting the price of pollution through taxation is great for ensuring a known cost of production (and thus certainty for investors), but this approach creates uncertainty about the total amount of resulting pollution.
17. Which policy, taxation or permitting, better maximizes total social welfare – accounting for all economic and environmental costs and benefits?
    - answer depends on the relative impacts of uncertain economic costs as compared to uncertain environmental costs. 

### Chapter 1 Four main questions in environmental economics

#### Four Economic Questions about Global Warming

1. How much pollution is too much?
   - “At what level are the benefits of pollution outweighed by its costs?
   - Zero pollution is an unachievable and undesirable goal; pollution a by-product of living
2. Is government up to the job?
3. How can we do better?
   -  Possible policies: regulations, taxes, permit systems, technology subsidies (or their removal), research incentives, infrastructure investment, right-to-know laws, product labeling, legal liability, fines, and jail terms.
4. Can we resolve global issues?
   - regulating pollution within a single nation is difficult, yet global warming transcends national boundaries

Highlighted terms:

1. Greenhouse gas - compound that traps reflected heat from the earth’s surface and contributes to global warming
2. The first major impact will be on patterns of temperature, flooding, and drought, affecting agricultural output.
   - Northerly regions may experience an increase in precipitation and yields, but the grain belts of the US, Australia, and central Europe will become drier and agricultural output will fall.
3. Natural ecosystems will suffer; boundary of forest ecosystems will move northward by 600 kilometers
4. Ocean acidification: ocean continues to acidify, life at the base of the ocean food chain could begin to die off
5. Sea-level rise as ice caps begin to melt, and the warming ocean expands
6. Catastrophic outcomes - collapse and melting of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets, raising sea levels by 40+ feet
7. Global warming is a consequence of the greenhouse effect: 
   - Solar energy enters the earth’s biosphere in the form of visible and ultraviolet light from the sun
   - much of it is radiated back into the biosphere as infrared radiation or heat
   - The CO2 and other greenhouse gases surrounding the earth let in the visible and ultraviolet light from the sun.
   - like a blanket, these gases trap the reflected infrared radiation (heat) close to the earth’s surface
8. Uncertainty in predicting the degree of global warming is due to positive and negative feedback effects
   - global warming will trigger a runaway greenhouse effect, in which the initial warming will feed on itself.

#### How much pollution is too much?

1. Kyoto global warming treaty - 1997 accords requires participating countries to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases to around 5% below 1990 levels by 2012
2. efficiency standard - use of benefit-cost analysis by economists is implicitly endorsing an unstated ethical goal: control pollution only if the measurable monetary benefits of doing so are greater than the measurable monetary costs
3. safety standard - reducing pollution to (socially defined) “safe” levels, unless the costs of doing so are prohibitive
4. ecological sustainability -  protecting natural ecosystems from major changes unless the costs of doing so are prohibitive

#### Is Government Up to the Job?

1. Two obstacles stand in the way of effective government action.
   1. **imperfect information** - Benefits such as cancers reduced, visibility improved, and ecosystems salvaged are hard to measure and even harder to quantify.
   2. **opportunity for political influence** - How much impact do ideology and raw political power have in determining what types of pollution are regulated, which natural resources are protected, and which polluters are punished?
2. conservatives - view governmental intervention as a necessary evil and argue for as limited a government role as is possible in all affairs, including environmental affairs.
3. progressives - view government as capable of promoting an activist agenda to serve the general interest of the public
   - argue that the problem with government involvement in the economy is not primarily the existence of pluralistic special interest groups but the dominance of big business and development interests in the legislative and regulatory process

#### How Can We Do Better?

1. Three categories of measures to control carbon dioxide emissions
   1. command-and-control regulation
      - current, dominant approach to environmental protection
      - government would regulate CO2 emissions by mandating the adoption of particular types of CO2 abatement technology
      - criticized as centralized, inflexible, much more costly than necessary
   2. incentive-based regulation
      - set emission targets and leave it up to industry to figure out the best way to comply
      - firms are provided with incentives to reduce emissions: 
      - economists believe this is best foundation to reduce pollution and resource degradation
        1. pollution tax
           -  tax based on the carbon content of fuels (a carbon or CO2 tax)
           -   raising the price of “dirty” (carbon-intensive) fossil fuels, the marketplace would promote “clean” (lower carbon) fuels like renewable electric power.
        2. cap-and-trade systems
           - a cap on total U.S. CO2 emissions
           - government would auction off just enough permits to emit a ton of CO2, so that the auctioned permits add up to the cap’s total.
           - 
   3. clean technologies
      - government can force firms to meet energy-efficient design standards, such as building codes
      - government could promote clean technological change through its investment activities

#### Can We Resolve Global Issues?

1. public good - a good that is consumed in common, like $CO_2$ reductions


### Chapter 2 The efficiency, safety and sustainability standards compared

Ethics and Economics

1. “How much pollution is too much?” is a **normative issue**
   - focuses our attention on what should be, rather than what is.
2. three different pollution standards: efficiency standard, safety standard, sustainability standard

#### Utility and Utilitarianism

1. **utilitarianism**
   -  human-centered (or anthropocentric) moral foundation underlying economic analysis
   - Economic analysts are concerned with human welfare or well-being
   - From the economic perspective, the environment should be protected for the material benefit of humanity and not for strictly moral or ethical reasons.
   - To an economist, saving the blue whale from extinction is valuable only insofar as doing so yields happiness (or prevents tragedy) for present or future generations of people
     - The existence of the whale independent of people is of no importance
2. biocentric view
   - independent of the utility of doing so, people have a moral responsibility to treat the earth with respect
3. Economists respond at the material level by assuming that the consumption of goods brings happiness or utility
   - includes both market goods and nonmarket goods (clean air, charitable deeds, mountaintop views, etc.)
4. utility function
   - ![Screen Shot 2022-08-26 at 1 11 19 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31806435/186983587-07e1ae03-92f6-48cb-95ec-87fa8c0de4f6.png)
   - + signs indicates Aldo's utility rises as he consumes each good
5. More is better: One additional assumption about this utility-consumption relationship

#### Social Welfare

1. social welfare function
   - ![Screen Shot 2022-08-26 at 1 13 00 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31806435/186983905-de892396-fe28-45a3-b783-cdb9b407d047.png)
     - + signs indicate that social welfare rises as each individual gets happier 
   - ![Screen Shot 2022-08-26 at 1 15 56 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31806435/186984169-d2e52d09-3792-4df9-af81-581dc0fc7a6a.png)
     - common social welfare function is the sum of individual utilities
     - original utilitarians believe this to be correct form, since "greatest good for the greatest number" should be the guiding principle for public policy
   -  They thought that to implement such a policy would require measuring utility in a precise way, and they devised elaborate methods for comparing the relative happiness derived from consumption by different individuals.
2. equal marginal utility of consumption
   - Unlike classical utilitarians, modern economists do not rely on direct measurements of utility
   - However, to determine the “correct” level of pollution from a social welfare perspective, we do need to weigh one person’s consumption against another’s
   - One social judgment we might make is that **additions** to consumption are valued equally by individuals
   - under this assumption, if your income goes up by a dollar and mine goes down by a dollar, social welfare will remain unchanged
3. problems with ![Screen Shot 2022-08-26 at 1 15 56 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31806435/186984169-d2e52d09-3792-4df9-af81-581dc0fc7a6a.png)
   1. increases in each person’s happiness receive equal weight
      - social welfare goes up at the same rate when the utility of either a millionaire or a street person rises
   2. also provides no special protection for the well-being of future generations
   3. also assumes that pollution victims have no special rights
   4. “adding up” mechanism underlying an efficiency standard for pollution control. 
      - Under an efficiency standard, the idea is to maximize the net benefits (benefits minus costs) of economic growth, by carefully weighing the benefits (more consumption) against the costs (pollution and resource degradation). 
      - This is done without reference to who bears the costs or gains the benefits.

#### Connections between Ecosystem Structure and Function, Services, Policies, and Values

![Screen Shot 2022-09-24 at 7 27 19 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31806435/192125593-dbeb15f9-789c-4918-a126-a6a6257fa024.png)

#### Overview of valuation methods

1. Wide variety of different methods
   - market based, stated preference, revealed preference, etc.
2. Considerable limitations and ranges of values
3. The idea of an objective process of converting values to monetary terms aligns with environmental economics but would be contested by ecological economists
4. Consideration needs to be given to differences in public vs private objectives and values

#### Valuation Methods

1. Production Function and Market Based Approaches
   - In this case the environmental good must be able to be treated as an input into the production process of something.
   - Therefore, changes in environmental quality would have direct effects on the levels of production of the good.
2. Opportunity Cost approach
   - Establishes the value of an environmental asset by estimating the value of alternative uses of the resources.
3. Dose-response approach
   - Used to estimate the pollution or environmental change effects on human and ecosystem health.
4. Replacement or Restoration Cost
   - Determines the value of an environmental asset by estimating the amount of money that would have to be spent to restore the environment to its previous undamaged state.
5. Substitutes, avoided or averted costs
   - Determines the value of an environmental asset by estimating the cost of alternative substitutes that would provide the same benefit/services
6. Revealed preference methodss
   - Can be used when in order to enjoy or benefit from an environmental asset, a person is willing to purchase related products that have defined values. For example:
     - **travel cost technique**: they are willing to spend time and money to visit a remote national park
     - **hedonic price analysis technique**: they are willing to pay more for a hilltop lot with a view, or they are willing to accept a lower wage to live in a rural area with more environmental amenities
7. Stated preference and contingent valuation methods
   - Stated preference methods obtain values by assuming a hypothetical market for an unpriced good or service and then asking a sample of people directly about the values that they attach to a specific environmental change. 
8. Choice experiments
   - Choice experiments ask people to evaluate combinations of attributes and prices.
   - A choice basket that might include: 
     - a specific level of pollution
     - a specific level of preservation
     - a specific level of employment
     - and a specific cost to the respondent.
   - By ranking these different combinations it is possible to isolate the value attached to particular environmental attributes.
9. Benefit transfer
   - Used to estimate economic values for ecosystem services by transferring available information from studies already completed at one or more sites to another location and/or context.
10. Cost benefit analysis and cost effectiveness analysis
    - Evaluates the costs and benefits of different projects, policies, or other alternatives over a period of time with a particular focus on net present values, benefit cost ratios, payback periods, and internal rates of return. 

### Travel Cost Method

[Travel cost method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EshPNDXe9kI) (~32m)

#### Categories of benefits and values

1. Three cateogires of unpriced benefits and corresponding values:
   1. direct-use benefits and values
   2. indirect-use benefits and values
   3. non-use benefits and values
2. Framework for environmental valuation
   - ![Screen Shot 2022-09-24 at 8 22 31 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31806435/192126806-856acf13-4b86-4366-bcc9-59e42566fd03.png)
3. Travel Cost method
   - Travel Cost analysis is a "revealed preference" method. 
   - It focuses on direct use values rather than indirect values or non-use values.
   - The method involvees collecting data on costs incurred by each individual travelling to the recreational site or amenity.   
     - This information is used to construct a demand curve where the costs incurred are the "price" paid by visitors (cost of driving, accomodation, entrance fees, etc.) and the quantity consumed is the number of visits (typically in a season or year).
   - The actual visitation expenditures represent a lower bound to their maximum willingness to pay.
     - However, actual expenditures do not capture _consumer surplus_ - the true measure of net economic benefit.
4. Consumer and Producer Surplus
   - ![Screen Shot 2022-09-24 at 8 39 33 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31806435/192127215-29fa06cc-7d13-4342-b391-b0595d1274a4.png)
