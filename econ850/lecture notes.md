#### Four Major Questions in Environmental Economics

1. How much pollution is too much?
   - What is "too much"?
     - Economic efficiency: maximizes net benefits (B-C)
        - Generate values for costs and benefits of environmental protection.
        - Apply the neoclassical economics framework to find the right level.
     - Safety: reduce pollution to "safe" levels
     - Economic sustainability: protect natural ecosystems from major changes (unless costs of doing so are prohibitive)
2. Is government up to the job?
   - Obstacles to effective government intervention:
     1. Imperfect information
     2. Political influence (who affects decisionmaking)
     3. Conflicts over property rights
     4. Conservative v progressive views of government's role
3. How can we do better?
4. Can we resolve global issues?
