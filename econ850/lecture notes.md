#### Four Major Questions in Environmental Economics

1. How much pollution is too much?
   - What is "too much"?
     - Economic efficiency: maximizes net benefits (B-C)
        - Generate values for costs and benefits of environmental protection.
        - Apply the neoclassical economics framework to find the right level.
     - Safety: reduce pollution to "safe" levels
     - Economic sustainability: protect natural ecosystems from major changes (unless costs of doing so are prohibitive)
2. Is government up to the job?
   - Obstacles to effective government intervention:
     1. Imperfect information
     2. Political influence (who affects decisionmaking)
     3. Conflicts over property rights
     4. Conservative v progressive views of government's role
3. How can we do better?
   - Tools
     1. "Command-and-control regulation"
     2. Policiees to promote clean technologies
        1. Research and development funding
        2. Subsidies for infant industries
        3. Infrastructure investment
        4. Technical efficiency standards
        5. Technical assistance
     3. Price system approaches, e.g.:
        - To achieve 4° F, global carbon tax of $70/ton today rising to $224/ton by 2050
        - To achieve 5° F, global carbon tax of $25/ton today rising to $93/ton by 2050
        - To achieve 5° F, emissions quotas for each country, with transferable credits
5. Can we resolve global issues?

#### How Hot will it get?
1. Atmospheric $CO^2$ levels in 1880: 280ppm. Now: +400 ppm.
2. Global temperature rise since 1880: 2.0° F (>1.0° C)
3. By 2100: +3° F to + 9° over 1800 levels.
4. Last Ice Age: Avg global temp ~9° F colder than today.
