# Benefits

- Employment
  - As of March 1991, approximately 5,000 and 14,200 Filipino civilian employees worked for the Air Force and Navy, respectively. (#1, p.2)
  - Upon leaving on March 1991, US paid for $52.7 million for severance pay, $15.5 million for accumulated sick and annual leave, and $3.1 mllion for bonuses. (Total liabilities for separation pay totaled $71.3 million) (#1, p.3)
  - Dictated by 1968 Base Labor Agreement, Colelctive Bargaining Agreement between the US Armed Forces Facilities and the Federation of Filipino Civilian Employees Association.

- Investments
  - US invested $2.199 billion in military facilities; $1.436 in removable property and $763 million in buildings and structures. (#1, p.3)

- Defense
  - Bases vital to U.S. national security interests during the Cold War; served as the launching pad for many anti-communist missions (#32, p.333)
    - Major staging areas in the Korean and Vietnam Wars; US initiated hudnreds of military operations in 70 countries from the PH. (National Security: Enduring Problems in a Changing Defense Environment 173, 2nd ed. 1991, Donald M. Snow)

# Costs

- Contaminated Sites
  - Enviromental Officers have identified contaminated sites and facilities that would not be in compliance with US environmental standards. (#1, p.27)
    - No soil and water testing has been conducted in the contaminated areas; the extent of the damage is not known.
    - both Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Navy Facility have common environmental problems with underground storage tanks and fne-fighting training facilities that do not comply with U.S. standards.
      - the underground storage tanks lack leak detection equipment, and fire-fighting facilities have no drainage systems.
      - the fuel and chemicals used in fire-fighting exercises seep directly into the soil and water table
      - at the Navy facility, the overflow goes directly into Subic Bay. 
   - Subic Bay Navy Facility does not have a complete sanitary sewer system and treatment facility. (#1, p.27)
     - sewage and process waste waters are discharged directly into Subic Bay; only 26 percent of the 6 million gallons of sewage generated daily is treated.
     - lead and other heavy metals from the ship repair facility’s sandblasting site drain directly into the bay or are buried in the landfill.
     - power plant contains unknown amounts of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) and emits untreated pollutants directly into the air. 
- University of Maryland scientists, however, conducted a comprehensive study of the Clark and Subic sites in 1993. (#2, p.344)
  - The study analyzed soil, water, and air samples from Clark and found traces of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), heavy metals, and high concentrations of a pesticide.
- The Philippine government later commissioned U.S.-based consulting firm, Weston International, to perform a baseline study of the soil and water at Clark. (#2, p.344)
  - Among other things, the Weston study confirmed that: 
    1. at least one pollutant (including mercury, lead, pesticide dieldrin, benzene, and toluene) existed in twenty-one test sites and none of these sites met drinking water standards;
    2. unsafe levels of contaminants remained in the soil at thirteen different test sites
    3.  many of these test sites were located within or very close to communities.

- Cleanup
  - Current Basing Agreement does not impose environmental responsibility while it operates the base or for cleanup upon withdrawal. (#1, p.3)
    - If US applied US environmental restoration standards, cleanup and restoration costs could approach Superfund proportions. (Superfund is administered by the EPA to clean up the nation's worst hazardous waste sites.) (#1, p.3)
    - Under current agreement, US has no liability for damage; DOD regulations require the services to comply with environmental pollution control standards of general applicability in the host country, but do not impose any specific responsibility for environmental restoration. (#1, p.3)
  - Basing Agreement does not impose environmental responsibilities upon US while it operates or for cleanup upon withdrawl. (#1, p.29)
    - "Hold-harmless" hold US harmless from any and all actions, claims, and expenses that could arise after relinquishment of a base.
  - "Environmental Pollution Control Standards of General Applicability in the Host Country" (#1, p.29)
    - Regulations generally indicate that U.S. forces are required to comply with all host country standards, as those standards are generally enforced by the host country. 
    - U.S. service officials in the Philippines told us that it does not appear that the Philippine government enforces these laws, either on its own citizens or on military bases. 
  - Official policy states U.S. military is supposed to follow the environmental regulations of the United States or of the host-country, whichever are more stringent. (#2, p.323)

# Currently

- [Balikatan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balikatan) "shoulder-to-shoulder"
  - US holds annual military exercises with Philippines (and Australia since 2014)
- VFA: Visiting Forces Agreement (#2, p.334)
  - Since 1998, both nationss waive all civil liability claims, which include claims for environmental torts.
  - VFA, art. VI, § 1. Both nations waive “any and all claims against each other for damage, loss or destruction to property of each other’s armed forces or for death or injury to their military and civilian personnel.”
