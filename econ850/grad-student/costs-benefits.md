# Benefits

- Employment
  - As of March 1991, approximately 5,000 and 14,200 Filipino civilian employees worked for the Air Force and Navy, respectively. (#1, p.2)
  - Upon leaving on March 1991, US paid for $52.7 million for severance pay, $15.5 million for accumulated sick and annual leave, and $3.1 mllion for bonuses. (Total liabilities for separation pay totaled $71.3 million) (#1, p.3)
  - Dictated by 1968 Base Labor Agreement, Colelctive Bargaining Agreement between the US Armed Forces Facilities and the Federation of Filipino Civilian Employees Association.

- Investments
  - US invested $2.199 billion in military facilities; $1.436 in removable property and $763 million in buildings and structures. (#1, p.3)

# Costs

- Contaminated Sites
  - Enviromental Officers have identified contaminated sites and facilities that would not be in compliance with US environmental standards. (#1, p.27)
    - No soil and water testing has been conducted in the contaminated areas; the extent of the damage is not known.
    - both Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Navy Facility have common environmental problems with underground storage tanks and fne-fighting training facilities that do not comply with U.S. standards.
      - the underground storage tanks lack leak detection equipment, and fire-fighting facilities have no drainage systems.
      - the fuel and chemicals used in fire-fighting exercises seep directly into the soil and water table
      - at the Navy facility, the overflow goes directly into Subic Bay. 
  

- Cleanup
  - Current Basing Agreemnt does not impose environmental responsibility while it operates the base or for cleanup upon withdrawal. (#1, p.3)
    - If US applied US environmental restoration standards, cleanup and restoration costs could approach Superfund proportions. (Superfund is administered by the EPA to clean up the nation's worst hazardous waste sites.) (#1, p.3)
    - Under current agreement, US has no liability for damage; DOD regulations require the services to comply with environmental pollution control standards of general applicability in the host country, but do not impose any specific responsibility for environmental restoration. (#1, p.3)
