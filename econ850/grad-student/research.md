  - The departure of the United States Navy left a huge clean-up to be completed. Soil and water was contaminated with lead, asbestos, PCBs, pesticides, and possibly nuclear waste from submarines. As of 2012, clean-up estimates for Subic Bay Naval Base and Clark Air Base were $40 million each.

  - Records of about 500 families who sought refuge on the deserted bases after a 1991 volcanic eruption indicate 76 people died and 68 others were sickened by pollutants on the bases. A study in 2000 for the Philippine Senate also linked the toxins to "unusually high occurrence of skin disease, miscarriages, still births, birth defects, cancers, heart ailments and leukemia."

### US Forces Are Leaving a Toxic Environmental Legacy in Afghanistan

[U.S. Forces Are Leaving a Toxic Environmental Legacy in Afghanistan - Scientific American.pdf](https://github.com/justinong415/sfsu/files/9641577/U.S.Forces.Are.Leaving.a.Toxic.Environmental.Legacy.in.Afghanistan.-.Scientific.American.pdf)
1. [Aug 30, 2021](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/u-s-forces-are-leaving-a-toxic-environmental-legacy-in-afghanistan/#)
2. Legal and practical obstacles make it difficult to clean the burn pits and health-damaging chemicals that remain at military bases
3. As part of the sites’ routine functioning, the American military and its allied partners generated waste, including substances that increase the risk of cancer and other diseases. 
4. A defunct military base may produce less pollution than an active one—for example, the uncovered remains of a burn pit present less direct harm than the active release of toxins from burning waste. 
   - But such a base still requires some degree of environmental remediation before it can be safely converted to civilian use.
   - In a 2017 report, the Government Accountability Office estimated the final cost of such cleanups in bases closed inside the U.S. between 1988 and 2015 would be nearly $15 billion.
5. “Afghan citizens face equal, if not greater, risk from exposure to burn pit pollutants. Nationals of the countries where these conflicts have taken place cannot leave as easily as occupying soldiers and must cope with the environmental aftereffects of war.”
6. Cleaning up after military bases becomes vastly more difficult outside U.S. states and territories because of legal obstacles and the need for diplomacy with a foreign government. 
   - For these locales, the U.S. can fund the remediation of environmental hazards at its bases only while they are in use: when the military withdraws from a base, a specific rule prohibits the DOD from directly spending money or using its resources “to meet requirements that are the responsibility of host nations, as stipulated in applicable international agreements.”
7. The department [can share information](https://biotech.law.lsu.edu/blaw/dodd/corres/pdf2/i47158p.pdf) about such hazards with the host country to assist in cleanup efforts, however. Just a few years later, the Institute for Policy Studies asserted that the “DOD has exploited this lack of explicit obligation by [conducting the absolute minimum of environmental restoration](https://ips-dc.org/overseas_military_bases_and_environment/) at overseas bases.”

### Life After Subic Bay

2. The impact of Subie Bay's closure will be felt in several ways. Economically, the base employed over 14,000 Filipino nationals and injected millions of dollars annually into the local economy. Strategically, it was home to nearly 5,000 military personnel, and 4,400 family members, and was a key logistical base in the region.

2. Subic Bay was once the site of one of the largest US naval bases in foreign territory. Today, as a significant economic center, the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA) promises genuine development for the Filipino economy.
   - Long dubbed "the sick man of Asia," the Philippines is finally catching up to its booming neighbors to become a newly industrialized country, and the SBMA is emerging as one of the major catalysts of this transformation.

### Global borderlands a case study of the Subic Bay Freeport Zone Philippines

[Global borderlands a case study of the Subic Bay Freeport Zone Philippines.pdf](https://github.com/justinong415/sfsu/files/9642130/Global.borderlands.a.case.study.of.the.Subic.Bay.Freeport.Zone.Philippines.pdf)

2. By developing the concept of "global borderlands"—semi-autonomous, foreign-controlled geographic locations geared toward international exchange—this article shifts the focus of globalization literature from elite global cities and cities on national borders to within-country sites owned or operated by foreigners and defined by significant social, cultural, and economic exchange. I analyze three shared features of these sites: semi-autonomy, symbolic and geographic boundaries, and unequal relations. The multi-method analyses reveal how the concept of global borderlands can help us better understand the interactions that occur among people of different nationalities, classes, and races/ethnicities and the complex dynamics that occur within foreign-controlled spaces. I first situate global borderlands within the literatures of global cities and geopolitical borderlands. Next, I use the case study of Subie Bay Freeport Zone (SBFZ), Philippines to show (1) how the semi-autonomy of global borderlands produces different regulations depending on nationality, (2) how its geographic and symbolic borders differentiate this space from the surrounding community, and (3) how the semi-autonomy of these locations and their geographic and symbolic borders reproduce unequal relations. As home of the former US Subic Bay Naval Base and current site of a Freeport Zone, the SBFZ serves as a particularly strategic research location to examine the different forms of interactions that occur between groups within spaces of unequal power.
