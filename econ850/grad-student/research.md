### US Forces Are Leaving a Toxic Environmental Legacy in Afghanistan

[U.S. Forces Are Leaving a Toxic Environmental Legacy in Afghanistan - Scientific American.pdf](https://github.com/justinong415/sfsu/files/9641577/U.S.Forces.Are.Leaving.a.Toxic.Environmental.Legacy.in.Afghanistan.-.Scientific.American.pdf)

2. Legal and practical obstacles make it difficult to clean the burn pits and health-damaging chemicals that remain at military bases
3. As part of the sites’ routine functioning, the American military and its allied partners generated waste, including substances that increase the risk of cancer and other diseases. 
4. A defunct military base may produce less pollution than an active one—for example, the uncovered remains of a burn pit present less direct harm than the active release of toxins from burning waste. 
   - But such a base still requires some degree of environmental remediation before it can be safely converted to civilian use.
   - In a 2017 report, the Government Accountability Office estimated the final cost of such cleanups in bases closed inside the U.S. between 1988 and 2015 would be nearly $15 billion.
5. “Afghan citizens face equal, if not greater, risk from exposure to burn pit pollutants. Nationals of the countries where these conflicts have taken place cannot leave as easily as occupying soldiers and must cope with the environmental aftereffects of war.”
6. Cleaning up after military bases becomes vastly more difficult outside U.S. states and territories because of legal obstacles and the need for diplomacy with a foreign government. 
   - For these locales, the U.S. can fund the remediation of environmental hazards at its bases only while they are in use: when the military withdraws from a base, a specific rule prohibits the DOD from directly spending money or using its resources “to meet requirements that are the responsibility of host nations, as stipulated in applicable international agreements.”
7. The department [can share information](https://biotech.law.lsu.edu/blaw/dodd/corres/pdf2/i47158p.pdf) about such hazards with the host country to assist in cleanup efforts, however. Just a few years later, the Institute for Policy Studies asserted that the “DOD has exploited this lack of explicit obligation by [conducting the absolute minimum of environmental restoration](https://ips-dc.org/overseas_military_bases_and_environment/) at overseas bases.”

2. George is among at least 400 active and closed military installations nationwide where the use of toxic chemicals has contaminated or is suspected of contaminating water on bases and nearby communities...
